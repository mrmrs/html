# HTML

Here, what I have shown is the pattern of Common Markup Language which I generally use to create my websites.

# Features

* All non-media elements in the HTML5 specification are included on one page and are ready to be styled.
* Modular Structure - Add your own patterns, or delete the ones you don't like.
* Semantic and Accessible Markup Examples for common design patterns.
* Thoroughly commented code (Notes and Reference links for new HTML developers)

# Getting the Code

* Create a new Repository for your project on Github itself.
* In terminal run
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/html.git yourNewRepoName
    cd [yourNewRepoName]
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
    git remote -v
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

Now you're set up to use this in a new project.

# Getting Started

## The HTML
* Open up index.html with your favorite text editor and hack away. It's that simple.
* To preview changes at http://localhost:8000 - open up terminal.app and type
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
